## Research Focus

My work lies at the intersection of **machine learning** and **scientific computing**. I develop and implement hybrid ML-solver systems to accelerate the optimization of large-scale physical models, particularly those described by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). My primary focus is on using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** to learn and replace core components of classical numerical solvers, aiming to reduce convergence time while preserving the rigorous accuracy guarantees required for engineering and scientific applications.

I am driven by a first-principles approach, building a deep understanding of the mathematical foundations of both neural networks and the numerical methods they are designed to enhance.

## Primary Research: AI-Enhanced Numerical Solvers

This is the focus of my final year dissertation, proposed for the **£9m Research England-funded M³4Impact programme**. The project investigates a hybrid ML framework to accelerate iterative PDE solvers through two primary thrusts:

1.  **2D CNN Warm-Starting:** A U-Net architecture is trained to predict a high-quality initial solution for the 2D Poisson equation, which is then fed into a Conjugate Gradient solver to reduce iteration counts.
2.  **3D GNN-in-the-Loop Preconditioning:** A Graph Neural Network is embedded within an Algebraic Multigrid (AMG) preconditioner, learning to replace the heuristic interpolation operator. The GNN is trained "in-the-loop" by backpropagating gradients through the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) solver to directly minimize the final residual.

**Core Methodologies:**
-   Solver-in-the-Loop Training
-   Graph Neural Networks on Unstructured Meshes
-   Hybrid ML-Numerical Methods
-   Large-Scale System Optimization

**Technical Stack:** Python, PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, FEniCS, SciPy, NumPy
